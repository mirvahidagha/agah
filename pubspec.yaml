# A version number is three numbers separated by dots, like 1.2.43
# followed by an optional build number separated by a +.
# Both the version and the builder number may be overridden in flutter
# build by specifying --build-name and --build-number, respectively.

  # To add assets to your application, add an assets section, like this:
  assets:
    - assets/images/
    - assets/launcher/agah.png
  #   - images/a_dot_ham.jpeg
  # An image asset can refer to one or more resolution-specific "variants", see
  # https://flutter.dev/assets-and-images/#resolution-aware.
  # For details regarding adding assets from package dependencies, see
  # https://flutter.dev/assets-and-images/#from-packages
  # To add custom fonts to your application, add a fonts section here,
  # in this "flutter" section. Each entry in this list should have a
  # "family" key with the font family name, and a "fonts" key with a
  # list giving the asset and other descriptors for the font. For
  # example:
  fonts:
    - family: Bold
      fonts:
        - asset: fonts/bold.otf

    #         style: italic
    - family: ExtraBold
      fonts:
        - asset: fonts/extra_bold.otf

    - family: Regular
      fonts:
        - asset: fonts/regular.otf
  #       - asset: fonts/TrajanPro_Bold.ttf
